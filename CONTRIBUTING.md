# Contributing

We ❤️  any and all support that you might have to offer. That being said, there are a few guidelines that you must read up on before getting started.

## Reporting Bugs 🐞

_Never_ feel hesitant to file a bug. We want to keep this framework battle-tested and bullet-proof, and it's up to you to help us. Think about it: the worst thing that can happen is you file an invalid bug, we figure out the issue, and suddenly your code is working again. Just make sure to [do a quick search][search-issues] for your problem before opening up a new issue.

Simply [create a new issue][new-issue] and we'll do our best to respond quickly. Some examples of when you should report a new issue:
- Crashes
- Deadlocks
- Unexpected behavior
- Compiler issues
- Things just aren't working right
- Need a friend

When filing a new issue, make sure you include the following:
- Xcode version
- Platform
- Your version or git SHA of Conduit
- A full stack-trace of a crash or deadlock, if applicable
- Steps on how to reproduce the issue, to the best of your ability
- Dependency manager (Carthage, CocoaPods, manual installation)
- Any additional info that might help

## Pull Requests 🏆

No pull request is too small; we will review and may potentially accept anything from whitespace changes to feature requests, so never be afraid to [submit a new pull request][new-pull-request]. Some examples might include:
- Bug fixes
- Feature gaps
- Feature requests
- Typos
- Documentation changes
- Xcode/Platform/Language Compatibility
- etc.

Make sure to complete every item on the checklist within [PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md][pull-request-template]. Code style, tests, documentation updates, and system design will all be evaluated on each request.

## Code of Conduct

We are very strict about good contributor behavior. We honor the Contributor's Covenant Code of Conduct to maintain a welcoming environment for all developers, regardless of experience levels, identity, or expression.
