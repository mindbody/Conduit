Conduit Demo
============

This example iOS project is set up to run against a local Node.js OAuth2 webserver. Before running the project, you'll need to start the server located at:
```
Tests/ConduitTests/oauth-test-server/
```

The server has a static set of client and user credentials that are managed in-memory. Feel free to tweak them for your own testing purposes

```
client_id: test_client
client_secret: test_secret
username: test_user
password: hunter_2
```
