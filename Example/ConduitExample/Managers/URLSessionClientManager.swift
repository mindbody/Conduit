 Each newly-initialized URLSessionClient constructs a new network pipeline
 that operates under a single provided URLSessionConfiguration. When copied, the
 constructed pipeline is passed by reference, and all other components (i.e. middleware)
 are passed by value.
 
 In most cases, you will want to define a single URLSessionClient for a single network
 session (makes sense, right?). Usually, this means a single client per OAuth2 application.
